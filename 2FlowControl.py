# Boolean values are values that equate to either True or False. 
booleanexample1 = True

# Python has comparision operators that will output as True or False.
# == equal to. 42 == 42 outputs 2. 41 == 42 outputs false.
# != not equal to. 42 != 41 outputs true. 42 != 42 is false.
# < less than. 42 < 43 is true. 42 < 41 is false.
# > greater than. 42 > 41 is true. 42 > 43 is false.
# <= less than or equal to. 42 <= 42 is true. 42 <= 41 is false.
# >= greater than or equal to. 42 >= 42 is true. 42 >= 43 is false. 

# == & != can work for any data type including strings. "Hello" == "Hello" is true. "Hello" == "hello" is false due to case sensitivity.
# == cannot work between strings and ints/floats, but == can work between floats and ints. 
# != would work mostly as intended between strings and ints/floats

print(42==42.0) #This will evaluate to true as both are numbers. 
print('42'==42) #This will evaluate to false becase '42' is different from 42. 

# Boolean operators exist. They are AND, OR, and NOT.
# AND evaluates to true if all parts of the expression are true. 
## True AND True = True. True AND False = False.
# OR evalautes to true if at least one of the parts of the expression are true.
## True OR True = True, True OR False = True, False OR False = False
# NOT inverts whatever the end result is.
## NOT True = False, NOT False = True. 
## NOT operators can be nested. NOT NOT True = True. 

# We can use comparison operators and boolean operators in conjunction with one another. 
print((5 > 3) and (5 >2))

# Flow control statements often start with a part called the condition and are always followed by a block of code called the clause.
# Conditions always evaluate down to a Boolean value, True or False. 
# A flow control statement decides what to do based on whether its condition is True or False.
# Almost every flow control statement uses a condition.

# Lines of Python code can be grouped together in blocks. 
# You can tell when a block begins and ends from the indentation of the lines of code. 
# There are three rules for blocks.
## Blocks begin when the indentation increases.
## Blocks can contain other blocks.
## Blocks end when the indentation decreases to zero or to a containing blockâ€™s indentation.
